# Release Please Action

[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-yellow.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

Automate releases with Conventional Commit Messages.

## Setting up this action

1. If you haven't already done so, create a `.github/workflows` folder in your
  repository (_this is where your actions will live_).
2. Now create a `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` file with these contents:

    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write

    name: release-please

    jobs:
      release-please:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
            with:
              release-type: node
              package-name: release-please-action
    ```

3. Merge the above action into your repository and make sure new commits follow
  the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  convention, [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
  will start creating Release PRs for you.
4. For an alternative configuration that provides easier bootstrapping options
  for initial setup, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/master/docs/manifest-releaser.md)
  (ignore the cli section) and then configure this action as follows:

    ```yaml
    #...(same as above)
        steps:
          - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
            with:
              command: manifest
    ```

## GitHub credentials

`release-please` requires a GitHub token to access the GitHub API. You configure this token via the
`token` configuration option. You can use the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret, however, note that any resources
created by `release-please` (release tag or release pull request) will not trigger future GitHub actions
workflows.

From the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow):
> When you use the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` to perform tasks, events triggered by the `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not create a new workflow run. This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs.

This means that GitHub actions CI checks will not run on the release pull request and workflows normally triggered by
`release.created` events will also not run. You will want to configure a GitHub actions secret with a
[personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
if you want other workflows to run.

### The `command` option
Some additional info regarding the `command` property.
- `github-release`: creates GitHub releases (as mentioned [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)) based on the most recently merged release PR and the release strategy being used.
- `release-pr`: uses Conventional Commits to propose a candidate release [pull request](#how-release-please-works). This pull request, once merged, is used by `github-release`/`manifest`
- `manifest`: use [source controlled files](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/main/docs/manifest-releaser.md#manifest-driven-release-please) containing releaser specific configuration (the `release-please-config.json`) as well package version tracking (the `.release-please-manifest.json`).
- `manifest-pr`: uses the manifest file `release-please-config.json` to propose a candidate release

### Workflow Permissions

This workflow will need the following permissions in your workflow file: 

```yml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
```

## How release please works

Release Please automates CHANGELOG generation, the creation of GitHub releases,
and version bumps for your projects. Release Please does so by parsing your
git history, looking for [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/),
and creating release PRs.

### What's a Release PR?

Rather than continuously releasing what's landed to your default branch,
release-please maintains Release PRs:

<img width="400" src="/screen.png">

These Release PRs are kept up-to-date as additional work is merged. When you're
ready to tag a release, simply merge the release PR.

### How should I write my commits?

Release Please assumes you are using [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:

* `fix:` which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
  patch.
* `feat:` which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
* `feat!:`,  or `fix!:`, `refactor!:`, etc., which represent a breaking change
  (indicated by the `!`) and will result in a SemVer major.

### Overriding the Changelog Sections

To output more commit information in the changelog,  a JSON formatted String can be added to the Action using the `changelog-types` input parameter.  This could look something like this:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
name: release-please
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        with:
          release-type: node
          package-name: release-please-action
          changelog-types: '[{"type":"feat","section":"Features","hidden":false},{"type":"fix","section":"Bug Fixes","hidden":false},{"type":"chore","section":"Miscellaneous","hidden":false}]'
```

### Supporting multiple release branches

`release-please` has the ability to target not default branches. You can even use separate release strategies (`release-type`).
To configure, simply configure multiple workflows that specify a different `default-branch`:

Configuration for `main` (default) branch (`.github/workflows/release-main.yaml`):
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
name: release-please
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        with:
          release-type: node
          package-name: release-please-action
```

Configuration for `1.x` (default) branch (`.github/workflows/release-1.x.yaml`):
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 1.x
name: release-please
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        with:
          release-type: node
          package-name: release-please-action
          default-branch: 1.x
```

## Automating publication to npm

With a few additions, the Release Please action can be made to publish to
npm when a Release PR is merged:

```yaml
on:

`registry-url` to your own [Wombat Dressing Room](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/wombat-dressing-room) deployment.

## Creating major/minor tags

If you are using release-please to publish a GitHub action, you will
likely want to tag a major and minor tag during a release, i.e., if you
are releasing `v2.8.3`, you will also want to update tags `v2` and `v2.8`. This allows your
users to pin to `v2`, and get updates to your library without updating their
workflows.

The `release-please-action` has the outputs `major`, `minor`, and
`release_created` to facilitate this. These outputs can be used conditionally,
like so:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
name: release-please
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        id: release
        with:
          release-type: node
          package-name: ${{env.ACTION_NAME}}
          command: github-release
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: tag major and minor versions
        if: ${{ steps.release.outputs.release_created }}
        run: |
          git config user.name github-actions[bot]
          git config user.email 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
          git remote add gh-token "https://${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action.git"
          git tag -d v${{ steps.release.outputs.major }} || true
          git tag -d v${{ steps.release.outputs.major }}.${{ steps.release.outputs.minor }} || true
          git push origin :v${{ steps.release.outputs.major }} || true
          git push origin :v${{ steps.release.outputs.major }}.${{ steps.release.outputs.minor }} || true
          git tag -a v${{ steps.release.outputs.major }} -m "Release v${{ steps.release.outputs.major }}"
          git tag -a v${{ steps.release.outputs.major }}.${{ steps.release.outputs.minor }} -m "Release v${{ steps.release.outputs.major }}.${{ steps.release.outputs.minor }}"
          git push origin v${{ steps.release.outputs.major }}
          git push origin v${{ steps.release.outputs.major }}.${{ steps.release.outputs.minor }}
```

## Manifest release output

When using a `manifest` command the outputs are modified to have a general
`releases-created` value to test if any releases were created. Package
specific outputs can be accessed by using the package path prefixed output.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
name: Run Release Please
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        id: release
        with:
          command: manifest
      - run: echo "A release was created."
        if: ${{ steps.release.outputs.releases_created }}
      # For root level packages: ${{ steps.release.outputs.package-a--tag_name }}
      - run: echo "Release ${{ steps.release.outputs['packages/package-a--tag_name'] }} created for package-a."
        if: ${{ steps.release.outputs['packages/package-a--release_created'] }}
```

## Updating additional files

You can update additional files with the `extra-files` input.

See the [generic updater docs](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/main/docs/customizing.md#updating-arbitrary-files) for more info on how release-please will update those files.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
name: release-please
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        with:
          release-type: node
          extra-files: |
            README.md
            docs/getting-started.md
```

## Attaching files to the GitHub release

You can attach additional files, such as release artifacts, to the GitHub release that is created. The `gh` CLI tool, which is installed on all runners, can be used for this.

This example uses the `gh` tool to attach the file `./artifact/some-build-artifact.zip`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
name: release-please
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        id: release
        with:
          release-type: node
      - name: Upload Release Artifact
        if: ${{ steps.release.outputs.release_created }}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run:
          gh release upload ${{ steps.release.outputs.tag_name }} ./artifact/some-build-artifact.zip
```
